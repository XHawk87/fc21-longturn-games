On the server
=============

The first steps can be inside or outside the tmux session, doesn't matter.

Step 1: update fc21
-------------------

cd src/freeciv21/
git fetch
git checkout v3.0-alpha.8  # Use most recent tag

In practice I had to checkout master to get a bugfix in freeciv21-ruleup
Please mention the version used in the game description!

Step 2: compile and install the latest version
----------------------------------------------

cmake --build build  # Takes a while
cmake --build build --target install

Step 3: convert ruleset
-----------------------

SIM30 is a 3.0 ruleset, it needs conversion to fc21.

FREECIV_DATA_PATH=data:~/fc21/share/freeciv21 ~/fc21/bin/freeciv21-ruleup -o SIM30_fc21 -r SIM30

Explanation:
FREECIV_DATA_PATH tells the command where to look for ruleset data
freeciv21-ruleup is the ruleset upgrading tool
-o selects where to put the thing
-r selects which ruleset to upgrade

Move it to the correct folder:

mv SIM30_fc21/ data/

Step 4: support files
---------------------

Easiest is to copy from another game

cp ../LTEx24/players.serv .
cp ../LTEx24/LTEx24.sh SIM30.sh

Then edit players.serv according to the players file
Also edit SIM30.serv:

* Change the rulesetdir to the new one
* Add "set nationset all"
* Add "read players.serv"
* Alter some settings used for tests (I think)

db.conf will be created automatically, don't add to git

Step 5: start game
------------------

As usual

Step 6: fix errors
------------------

Including a new bug in fc21 :'(

To do
=====

* Make the converted SIM ruleset available through the modpack installer
